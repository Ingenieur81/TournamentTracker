## Application requirements:
1. Track games played and their outcome (who won)
2. Multiple competitors play in the tournament
3. Creates a tournament plan (who plays in what order)
4. Schedule games
5. A single loss eliminates a player
6. The last player standing is the winner

## Questions to get a better understanding of what the full requirements are
1. How many players will the tournament handle? Is it variable?
2. If a tournament has less than the full complement of players, how do we handle it?
3. Should the ordering of who plays each other be random or ordered by input order?
4. Should we schedule the game or are they just played whenever?
5. If the games are scheduled, how does the system know when to schedule games for?
6. If the games are played whenever, can a game from the second round be played before the first round is complete?
7. Does the system need to store the score of some kind or just who won?
8. What type of front-end should this system have (form, webpage, app, etc.)?
9. Where will the data be stored?
10. Will this system handle entry fees, prizes, or other payouts?
11. What type of reporting is needed?
12. Who can fill in the results of the game?
13. Are there varying levels of access?
14. Should this system contact users about upcoming games?
15. Is each player on their own of can teams use this tournament tracker?
